It requires critical problem-solving, teamwork and integrity.\nMedical practitioners are passionately interested in wellbeing, and work to protect and promote the health of individuals and communities. They are dedicated to alleviating pain and suffering, and caring for vulnerable people.\nWhat will you do?\nOur Bachelor of Medical Studies provides the foundation knowledge and skills needed to excel in health care. Learning in partnership with outstanding clinicians in our state-of-the-art Adelaide Health and Medical Sciences building, you will: work in small groups to address scenario-based problems relating to common and important individual, community, Indigenous and global health issues; gain valuable exposure to real-world clinical practice and develop your own safe and effective clinical skills in cutting-edge simulation facilities; investigate the social determinants of health and health behaviours; learn to evaluate the health status of individuals and populations; acquire a solid foundation in research skills and evidence-based care; learn collaboratively in interprofessional teams.\nYou will also gain a deep understanding of how our health care system works. This includes from the ‘consumer’ perspective; how patients interact with various health services and providers.\nWhere could it take you?\nThis is the first part of our medicine program; upon completion, you’ll gain direct entry into our Doctor of Medicine. Together, these degrees will qualify you to practise medicine anywhere in Australia and throughout most of the world.\nThe Medical program at the University of Adelaide has a six-year full-time duration which leads to the awards of Bachelor of Medical Studies and Doctor of Medicine. Entry to the Doctor of Medicine is based on completion of the Bachelor of Medical Studies at the University of Adelaide.\nCareer Readiness\nUpon completion of the Bachelor of Medical Studies and Doctor of Medicine, graduates are required to apply for provisional registration with the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA). Provisional registration is required to undertake a 12 month internship which provides supervised clinical experience in an approved hospital.\nAfter successful completion of the internship, graduates are eligible to apply to APHRA for general registration, allowing them to practise in Australia and New Zealand.\nInternships are separate from the medical degree and the University of Adelaide does not facilitate the internship placements. It is current practice that SA Health guarantees an intern placement for South Australian commonwealth-supported medical graduates. International medical graduates may need to complete an intern placement in their home country. Further information regarding internship allocations can be found on the SA Health Careers and SA Medical Education and Training website.\nAdelaide Medical School graduates are well regarded in the industry for their knowledge and experience, and are in demand for positions in public hospitals, private practice, public health, teaching, clinical research, aid organisations, the defence forces and more. The full, wide range of medical career paths and options become apparent as students’ progress through the degree.\nThe University of Adelaide Careers Service prepares, inspires and empowers students to achieve successful career transitions and connect with industry.\nPotential careers\nHealth Educator, Health Officer, Laboratory Manager, Medical Scientist, Medical Technician",
